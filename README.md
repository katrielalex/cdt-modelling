cdt-modelling
=============

Code for the systems modelling assignment at the Oxford Cyber Security CDT.

Uses a traffic flow dataset available at
http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/nprobe/data/papers/sigmetrics/index.html,
loads up a few features from it, draws some graphs, and trains a
scikit-learn classifier to see whether it's easy to classify traffic
flows into various categories.

Hint: it's not.
